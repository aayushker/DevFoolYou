Vulnerabilities are everywhere, discovering bugs in highly used websites is daily news at this point. We present a solution-BugBase an Indian Bug Bounty platform",,,"We are faced with the challenge of making a large-scale web application in a 2 day time period which goes with an API in the backend. We decided to go with an approach that allows creating a single page application (SPA) which are known to be much faster than applications which serve the entire page e.g. Using res.render in NodeJS. This also allowed us to build the frontend and backend completely separately making the development of the product during the hackathon much faster as we assigned two members to each.
We decided to use NodeJS along with MongoDB as the building blocks for the backend API. We also used AWS S3 buckets to store the user profile pictures and any other large data that is generated including PDFs. We purchased the domain bugbase.in from GoDaddy and set up an email admin@bugbase.in with Zoho Mail. For the frontend, we chose to go with the frontend framework VueJS to manage all our routing and making API calls. The API is hosted on http://api.bugbase.in which has two routes /api/auth and /api, /api/auth is where the user gets authenticated and a JWT gets generated which can be used to access the /api route in the API. The frontend fetches the data using Axios and displays the data on the users end i.e. On http://bugbase.in. All have SSL certificates as they have been proxied through Cloudflare."
